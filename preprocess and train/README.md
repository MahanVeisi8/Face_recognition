## Project Overview

The notebook includes detailed steps for data handling, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It covers the following key aspects:
- Setting up the environment and importing necessary libraries.
- Loading and preprocessing image data.
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
- Building and training an ensemble model using architectures like MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3.
- Evaluating model performance and analyzing misclassifications.

## Setup Instructions

To run this notebook, you need access to a Python environment with TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.4 keras numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. If using Google Colab, make sure to mount your Google Drive to access datasets:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

## Notebook Details

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include resizing images, converting images to the appropriate color scale, and normalizing the pixel values. The notebook uses multi-threading to efficiently load and process large sets of image data from disk.

### Model Training

The project utilizes a combination of different CNN architectures, leveraging pretrained models like MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and custom layers for classification. The training process is detailed with strategies for handling overfitting, such as early stopping and dropout layers.

### Evaluation and Analysis

After training, the model is evaluated on a held-out test set. The performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are plotted over epochs. The notebook also includes a section for visualizing incorrect predictions to analyze the model's weaknesses and potential biases.

## Results

The notebook provides graphs and metrics that demonstrate the model's performance. For instance:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs.
- Test set accuracy.
- Examples of correct and incorrect predictions.

### Key Points:
1. **Clarity and Detail**: The README should give a clear overview of what the notebook achieves and how each part of the project contributes to the final goal.
2. **Setup Instructions**: Detailed setup instructions ensure that anyone can clone the repository and get the notebook running without any issues.
3. **Documentation**: The notebook itself should be well-documented with comments explaining why certain steps are taken (e.g., why certain preprocessing steps are needed).
4. **Results and Visualization**: Include explanations of the results and what they mean for the project. Visual aids can help illustrate the performance and issues of the model.

This template should give you a solid foundation to build on, adapting and expanding as necessary to fit the specifics of your project and any additional content or sections you might want to include.
