## Project Overview

The notebook includes detailed steps for data handling, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It covers the following key aspects:
- Setting up the environment and importing necessary libraries.
- Loading and preprocessing image data.
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
- Building and training an ensemble model using architectures like MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3.
- Evaluating model performance and analyzing misclassifications.

## Setup

**Running the Notebook in Google Colab**
- The notebook is designed for easy execution in Google Colab, requiring no additional setup other than a Google account and internet access.ðŸ˜Š
  
The code is designed to run in a Python environment with essential machine learning and simulation libraries. You can execute the notebook directly in Google Colab using the badge link provided, which includes a pre-configured environment with all necessary dependencies.


## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include resizing images, converting images to the appropriate color scale, and normalizing the pixel values. The notebook uses multi-threading to efficiently load and process large sets of image data from disk.

## Model Training

The project utilizes a combination of different CNN architectures, leveraging pretrained models like MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and custom layers for classification. The training process is detailed with strategies for handling overfitting, such as early stopping and dropout layers.

## Evaluation and Analysis

After training, the model is evaluated on a held-out test set. The performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are plotted over epochs. The notebook also includes a section for visualizing incorrect predictions to analyze the model's weaknesses and potential biases.

## Results

The notebook provides graphs and metrics that demonstrate the model's performance. For instance:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs.
- Test set accuracy.
- Examples of correct and incorrect predictions.
